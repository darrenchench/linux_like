WindowsAll--The most popular os in the world now desktop/laptop/pad,also has the market share 35% in servers/industry/manufacture.it has the most softwares/tools.Daily use for learning/internet/relax. User-friendly other than developer-friendly cause it is not open-source/complexity programming.As a server,I think it is not a good choice cause it is not very stable for long time running.Maybe one-day it would pulic its source code,I am sure it would be very sophiscated/genius.
Ubuntu---The most popular linux distribution version. Easy to use.And rising in web server market cause many startup using latest ruby2/js/pytjon3 version to deploy their aplication/service.Eating up the market share of centos/redhat.The gui desktop is changing from 1 verion to another constantly.
Centos/redhat--The stable linux server with reliable support. It has the market share of 35%.
MacOS---Based of BSD Unix,gui is quite shinning,sometimes a little confusing.and why the macos hides all the directories from ordinary users.For developping is good choice with its unix nature.
Freebsd/netBSD/OpenBSD/TrueOS---Still has some market share in the web servers less than 10% cause its stable/simple.
Solaris---Installing/tuning/monitoring in the telecom company,slow ,stable,old school.
HPUX---Installing/tuning/monitoring in the telecom company,slow ,stable,old school.
IBM AIX---Installing/tuning/monitoring in the telecom company,slow ,stable,old school.
ios---Closed source (proprietary software) worse example of monopoly.shortage of the apps/battary/sim card/memory/freedom.
Android---open source ,and ample of apps/battary/sim card/memory/freedom
SLE---stable,mediocre

winderriver linux--- running on network switches/routers.must-have
LFS--Linux from scratch, at least need 2 weeks to compile,give a clear view of linux architecture.
